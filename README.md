## Description
This project aims to analyse and improve the order fulfilment process at Nexus Logistics Solutions, a major logistics provider currently experiencing rising delivery backlogs, reduced customer visibility, and increasing operational costs. Using Microsoft Excel, the project develops an interactive dashboard to identify bottlenecks, monitor order progress, and support data-driven decision-making.
Through this analysis, the project seeks to enhance delivery efficiency, optimise resource allocation, reduce delays, and improve customer satisfaction while restoring the company’s strong reputation for reliable service.

### Business Introduction
Nexus Logistics Solutions is a long-standing leader in the supply chain and logistics industry, with over two decades of operational excellence. The company is known for its reliable and efficient delivery of a wide range of products across the country. Over the years, it has maintained a strong reputation for speed, dependability, and customer service.
However, recent operational challenges have started to impact delivery performance and customer satisfaction. To maintain service excellence, it became essential to address these issues using a data-driven approach.

### Business Problem
In the order fulfilment process, the company is currently facing:
- Mounting Order Backlogs due to inefficient routing and resource allocation, affecting delivery timelines.
- Limited Order Visibility for customers, resulting in confusion and communication gaps.
- Customer Frustration caused by delayed deliveries and inadequate status updates.
- Rising Operational Costs due to overtime and expensive expedited shipping.

### Rationale for the Project
Order fulfilment involves receiving, processing, and delivering customer orders. When inefficiencies or high demand occur, backlogs develop, leading to delays, increased costs, and dissatisfied customers.
This project focuses on eliminating these backlogs and improving fulfilment efficiency because:
 - Customer satisfaction relies on timely deliveries.
 - Operational efficiency drives profitability and competitive advantage.
 - Data insights improve routing, workforce planning, and resource use.
 - Proactively solving these issues strengthens Nexus Logistics Solutions’s reputation.

### Aim of the Project
This project focuses on developing an interactive Excel dashboard to optimise order fulfilment and eliminate delivery backlogs. Through this, I aim to:
Allocate delivery resources efficiently based on volume and location.
- Track order progress and detect delays in real-time.
- Improve customer communication with timely order status updates.
- Reduce operational costs and order backlogs.
Increase customer satisfaction and preserve the company’s reputation.

### The dataset used in this project contains the following fields:

- Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.
- Delivery Address: Destination for the order.
- Order Timestamp:  When the order was placed (e.g., 2023-09-01 08:00).
- Order Status:  Statuses such as 'In Progress' or 'Completed'.
- Driver ID:  Unique ID of the assigned delivery driver.
- Vehicle Info:  Details of the vehicle used.
- Delays:  Any delay duration (e.g., 15 min).

### Tech Stack
Tool: Microsoft Excel
- Dashboard Development: Creating interactive visual reports
- Data Processing: Using Excel formulas, functions, and data tools
- Data Visualisation: Charts and pivot table for insights
- Reporting:  Filters, slicers, and dynamic views of order metrics

## Project Scope and Workflow
### Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and formatted raw data
- Standardised timestamps, locations, and IDs
- Resolved missing, inconsistent, and duplicate entries

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Investigated order trends and delivery performance
- Identified bottlenecks, delay sources, and backlog patterns
- Used statistics, pivot tables, and descriptive summaries

### Data Transformation
- Converted timestamps into usable time-based metrics
- Normalised fields for dashboard integration
- Derived KPIs such as delivery time, backlog rate, and delay frequency

### Data Analysis

- Assessed delivery performance by driver, vehicle, and area
- Tracked orders by status, location, and time of day
- Evaluated average delivery time vs. delay time

### Data Visualisation

<img width="1703" height="838" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/826be85f-c894-4649-a593-77167c54f24f" />

I created visual elements such as:
- Backlog trends
- Delivery time tracking
- Orders by driver or region
- Delay frequency insights
- Real-time progress summaries

### Dashboard Design
I designed a fully interactive Excel dashboard featuring:
- Slicers for filtering by driver, date, or status
- KPIs for order volume, backlog count, and delay time
- Pivot charts and visual maps for quick decision-making
- Status monitoring and performance tracking

### Insight Generation
Through the dashboard and analysis, I derived insights into:
- Causes of delays and backlogs
- Regional delivery inefficiencies
- Driver performance trends
- Peak order periods
- Opportunities to reduce costs and improve Service
### Recommendations
I documented the entire process and provided actionable recommendations to:
- Optimise driver allocation
- Improve customer communication
- Implement real-time tracking
- Reduce overtime and expedited delivery costs.
